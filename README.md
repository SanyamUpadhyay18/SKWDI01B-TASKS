Word Prediction using LSTM

*Description*
Next word prediction:
If given the three words of a sentence, it should be able to guess the fourth. Long-Short-Term Memory is what I’m employing in this situation.
Note: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is a tool used in deep learning, and LSTM falls under this category. Input, output, forget, and cell are the components of a typical LSTM unit.


LSTM = Long short term memory
GRU = Gated Recurrent Unit
RNN may fail under long term dependency. LSTM and GRU comes into the picture to solve this.
In LSTM we have:
1. Forget gate
2. Input gate
3. Cell state
4. Output gate

In GRU we have,
1. Update gate
2. Reset gate
Both of these LSTM and GRU are powerful enough to handle competitive task.
We have to choose on the basis of our project whether to choose LSTM or GRU.


Steps to run the code:
1.Open Jupyter Notebook and make new file .
2.Run the following steps one by one .
3. Import libraries
4. Load your file
5. Open and pre-process the data
6.Implement tokenization and make additional adjustments.
7.Creating the model
model.
8.Train the model.
9.Let’s predict.
